Layout: Force Atlas 2 (Scaling 50.0, Prevent Overlap) 
Statistics: Network Diameter to obtain Betweenness Centrality; Modularity for community detection.
Node Color: Partition nodes on Modularity.
Node Size: Based on Betweenness Centrality 
Label size is based on node size.
Used the degree filter to remove the labels for unimportant nodes.
