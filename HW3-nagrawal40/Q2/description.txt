line23: 
Create dataframe "incoming" with edge and its incoming weight using tab separated input file.
Edge will be 2nd token (p(1)) and weight will be 3rd token (p(2)).
Use filter to get weight values >= 5
line28: 
Create dataframe "outgoing" with edge and its outgoing weight using tab separated input file.
Edge will be 1st token (p(0)) and weight will be 3rd token (p(2)).
Use filter to get weight values >= 5
line33:
Create dataframe by grouping "incoming" on edge and aggregate using sum.
line34:
Create dataframe by grouping "outgoing" on edge and aggregate using sum.
line37:
Use outer join to create dataframe "combinedDf" by joining on edge.
line40: 
Replace the null weights in "combinedDf" by 0, and coalesce edge.
line43:
Create dataframe "output" using "combinedDf" edge and subtract "outgoing_weight" from "incoming_weight".
line46:
Map dataframe to create tab separated output and save it in file.
